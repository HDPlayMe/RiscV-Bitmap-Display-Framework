# RiscV-Bitmap-Display-Framework

This repository contains the RiscV Bitmap Display Framework. It includes the source code for the framework, as well as documentation and examples. 
The framework is designed to simplify the process of using the bitmap display on the RiscV (RARs) platform. It includes functions for drawing basic 
shapes, text, and images. We believe that it is important that all users are able to easily understand this framework, and the best way to achieve 
this is through explanation in Spanish. Is for this reason that all explanations for the contents of this course will be found in the "HELP" folder
fully in Spanish. We hope that this will be helpful for those who want to learn how to use this framework for their own projects. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us and we will do our best to answer your inquiries.
